Adding Static Content (CSS & JS)

Adding static content such as css or javascript code to in Spring Boot just take a couple 
steps. Spring Boot automatically looks inside the static folder
located at src/main/resources. This folder is where we will put
our static CSS and JavaScript files. For file organization, we will create a css folder
, and a js folder.  For this course all of our web pages will
dynamically render data from the server side using .jsp files, so we will store
any files we want rendered in the WEB-INF folder rather than in the static folder.
First let's add some CSS!

    *Create a new CSS file by going to new -> other -> then search for "css".

    *Be careful to put it in src/main/resources/static as it may suggest putting it elsewhere.
     Place the new css file in a new folder called css. You may name the file as you like, style.css or main.css are conventional.

    *Add the link tag in your .jsp file to any external resources, just as you would an html file.

    *You can also add any other static files you need like JavaScript!

src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/index.jsp

	<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title>hello world</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/style.css">
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/app.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello world, with some style!</h1>
	</body>
	</html>


src/main/resources/static/css/style.css


	h1 {
    	color: blue;
	}

	src/main/resources/static/js/app.js

	alert("Hello World");


	And in our Controller:

	// ...
	@RequestMapping("/")
	public String index() {
    	return "index.jsp";
	}
	// ...

Now, we can request our static html file directly from the server. Navigate to localhost:8080 to see our file.
